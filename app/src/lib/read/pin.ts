/**
 * The producer this app is built against, recorded in one place.
 *
 * The producer publishes API contracts from api-contracts/ in this repository.
 * The app imports them in place through the `api-contracts/*` alias and never
 * copies them. The contract is pinned by version plus the SHA-256 of each
 * package's manifest.json, the file that in turn hashes every schema, type,
 * fixture and runtime in the package.
 *
 * tests/contract-pin.test.mjs recomputes every digest below from the files the
 * build actually imports, so a producer change fails CI instead of silently
 * reaching the screen. `producerCommit` is informational: CI can check the
 * bytes, not which commit produced them.
 *
 * Three independent contracts are pinned below, each with its own version and
 * its own digest: read-v1 (rc.3, unchanged), read-v2's opt-in pool APR
 * estimates, and read-v3's stored public observations, paged discovery and
 * denominated history. read-v3 is additive — it took nothing away from v1 or
 * v2, and the Worker serves all three at once.
 *
 * The producer commit below is a5f71f1, which carries the local RPC source,
 * persisted public token data, and acquisition separated from reads. Later
 * producer commits changed backend sources the manifests digest without
 * changing a route, a schema or a version, which is why the versions here did
 * not move while the digests did. The onboarding-v1 and deposit-v1 digests
 * moved again with the slippage bound: every request that carries a
 * `slippageBps` now takes 10 to 500 basis points (lib/create/slippage.ts holds
 * the same numbers), and the versions stayed where they were.
 *
 * session-v1 is at 3.0.0-rc.3 because the producer dropped `wallet_not_allowed`
 * from its closed error set with the per-wallet whitelist (issue #182). The
 * onboarding-v1, performance-v2 and execution-v1 digests moved with it: those
 * manifests hash backend sources the same change touched, and the last two
 * inherit the session error table, without any of the three changing a route,
 * a schema shape or a version.
