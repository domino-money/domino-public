/**
 * The V2 API contracts this app is built against (spec F7 rev2 §2.4, §6.2), pinned as src/lib/read/pin.ts pins V1's:
 * the contract version and the SHA-256 of the package's manifest.json, whose `files` list hashes every file the app
 * and its tests read (tests/v2/pins.test.mjs recomputes both). A producer change that lands in the tree fails that test
 * before any screen validates a payload against a contract it was not built for. Kept apart from lib/read/pin.ts so
 * V1's pin module is byte for byte what it was.
 *
 * Both packages are candidates, switched off until the deploy and the Worker routes exist:
 * - read-v6 `1.0.0-rc.1` (main 4edd0720, #305): `candidate_disabled_pending_bridge_and_deployment`;
 * - position-plan-v1 `1.0.0-rc.2` (PR #308 a620b6d1): `candidate_disabled_pending_deployment_and_worker`.
